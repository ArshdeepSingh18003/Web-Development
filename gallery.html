		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: sans-serif;">Single-hood.</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">Going Solo is the autobiographical sequel of Boy, which is written by the world-famous author Roald Dahl. It is about his life as a worker with the Shell Company and an RAF fighter pilot. He has had an adventurous life and I am sure you would envy him once you have read it. It is a book that your grandfather and father would have read with infinite enthusiasm.</p>
			 <p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">I would suggest you take a seat next to the 
        toilet door in case you have the urge to run in after you have laughed your head off turning pages of this book.The book starts off when Roald Dahl is sailing on the S.S Mantola to Africa, the onset of his life as a Shell worker. On the way he meets many extraordinary people and sees new feats. He befriends the dotty major and his wife on the ship and sees a lion carrying his host's cook's wife away in his mouth. He sees the snake man in action as he silently creeps into a house to catch the fatal green mamba.</p> 
		     <p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">A crash in the desert hurts his head and brings
		out many problems in his flying days in Greece. Of course, you would get scared and you would wet your pants in the second half if you were not ready for the stunts of the RAF daredevils. Roald Dahl has certainly brought out his past in a spectacular way for children like us to enjoy the danger of fifteen Hurricanes in the middle of thousands of Messerschmitts.</p> 
			<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">This book is a perfect bedtime story and also 
		inspirational book about the will to survive even when it may seem hopeless. It brings the need to end all the nightmares about ghosts in castles and all other fantasies as you enter the world and time of World War II when you did not know the timing of bombings and one wrong step would prove fatal. Climb into your imaginary hurricane and get ready to fly high into the air with Roald Dahl.</p>

		<center><img src="image/b2.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive;">Lesson 1: Always be willing to update your view of the world.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">Most of our decisions to be dishonest originate
		from irrational thinking. When we lie, consciously or not, we’ve often just fallen prey to so-called cognitive biases, like the backfire effect, survivorship bias or irrational escalation. It’s easy to raise a finger and say: “Always be honest!” A lot of gurus do that.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">That’s why I like the words Peck uses: A
		dedication to truth. He doesn’t emphasize being honest so much, as that’s often out of our control. What matters, he suggests is that we remain open to being wrong. How willing are you to change your opinion at a moment’s notice? It’s hard. It takes a lot of humility.</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 30px; font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">Sometimes, even when we’re presented with an
		opportunity to get a better understanding of reality, like facts that prove we’re wrong, we still can’t change our mind. Worse, we might even reaffirm our rusty and false beliefs (this is the backfire effect in action). You don’t have to cheer when you learn you’re on the wrong track, but if you can pause and entertain the idea of a new opinion at any time, you’re already closer to the truth than most people.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive;">Lesson 2: Love is an action, not a feeling.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">One of Sigmund Freud’s many contributions to the field of psychology was the idea of cathexis. It’s defined as the investment of emotional energy into an object or a person, often to an extent that’s unhealthy. Think of it like a romantic obsession or overdose of sexual desire.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Peck says cathexis happens when we intently focus on the “falling in love” aspect of a relationship that often happens early on. As a consequence, our love might burn with a bright flame, but soon fizzle into sparks before extinguishing altogether.</p>

		<center><img src="image/b5.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive;">The Outward Mindset: Seeing Beyond Ourselves</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">In The Outward Mindset, the Arbinger Institute reports that “the biggest lever for change is not a change in self-belief but a fundamental change in the way one sees and regards one’s connections with and obligations to others.”</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">People and organizations get stuck when they have an inward mindset because when we are focused on ourselves and our needs, our reality becomes distorted. An inward mindset limits our possibilities and negatively affects our behavior and thus our relationships.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Arbinger reminds us that an inward mindset and introspection are not the same thing. “One can introspect in a self-centered way, which would indicate an inward mindset. However, a person also can introspect about one’s connections with others, which is the very essence of what we are calling outwardness. Sometimes it is helpful to look inside to see how one is connected with what is outside.” </p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Moving from an inward mindset to an outward mindset is more that a surface adjustment or behavioral change alone. It requires a change in how we see and thing about others. How we see and respond to others is not so much about them as it is a reflection of what is going on inside of us. We often fixate on other’s shortcomings so we don’t have to deal with our own. Inward-mindset people and organizations do things. Outward-mindset people and organizations help others to be able to do things.” It is possible to be a inward-mindset person or organization masquerading as an outward-mindset person or organization if you aren’t paying attention to the needs, objectives, and challenges of those you are supposedly doing the work for. Whose needs are your primary focus? </p>

		<center><img src="image/b6.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive;">"Incivility sucks something out of all of us. It takes us on an emotional roller­coaster ride. It siphons cognitive resources. It even eats away at physical health. Ultimately, we become a fraction of ourselves. We don’t show up to the same extent. If you’re experiencing incivility, don’t brush it off."</p><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">In addition to tackling more strategic and systemic actions that leaders can take to create or restore civility (e.g., hiring, coaching and measurement practices,) Porath spends a chapter on “fundamentals.” These are “the small behaviors that we frequently overlook that allow us to connect by being more attentive.” Each of these is something we can do by behaving just a bit differently in any given moment.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">Here’s each of those three behaviors—with a bit of context.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"><strong>Smiling:</strong> While we know how a smile feels, I still found the research surprisingly powerful. Smiling is a mood booster—for the smiler and the person who is the recipient. It’s contagious, too. And, since it’s hard to fake a smile, if you want to smile more, do it from the “inside-out.” Think of something that genuinely makes you happy and allows you to smile.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"><strong>Building relationships with subordinates:</strong> Acknowledge, connect with, relate to the people who report to you. While this sounds obvious—in reality, it often is missing. How do you start your day? What rituals do you have through which you connect with your team? Do you take the time with your team members? How do you override distance when you have a virtual team?</p>

		<center><img src="image/b7.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">You can’t possibly call yourself a habit junkie and not know this book. It’s THE book about habits. Published in 2012 by Pulitzer-prize winning author Charles Duhigg, this gem has spent over 120 weeks on the various New York Times bestseller lists.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">The book was sparked by Duhigg’s fascination with the wit of a U.S. army major in Kufa in Iraq, who nipped riots in the bud by persuading the small town’s mayor to keep food vendors out of large and growing gatherings – when people couldn’t fuel their anger and energy with kebabs, as they usually did, they just left. Tons of research and 8 years later, Duhigg published the go-to book about habits.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Here are your 3 must-takeaways:</p>
			<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">1. Habits work in 3-step loops: cue, routine, reward.</p>
		    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">2. You can change your habits by substituting just one part of the loop, the routine.</p>
	        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">3. Willpower is the most important habit, and you can strengthen it over time with 3 things.</p><br>
	        <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;"><strong>Lesson 1:</strong> Habits work in 3-step loops: cue, routine, reward.</p>
	        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Habits are your brain’s way of saving energy, so given you spend around 6 of your 16 waking hours doing things you’re not aware of, it might be worth understanding what happens here.Duhigg discovered that at the root of all habits, like drinking your coffee every morning, lies a simple 3-part loop.The cue is what triggers you to do the habit, for example sitting down at your kitchen table to have breakfast every morning at 7 AM.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">1: Waking Up is Hard to Do</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">We should be free to lead our lives as we choose. A bit of 'time-wasting' isn't bad if it enhances our happiness. A little down-time can actually be very productive as it allows us to step back and examine what we are doing, and creative inspiration often comes subconsciously in background thought. Maximum productivity does not translate to maximum happiness.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">2: Toil and Trouble</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Self-employed independence is a much happier state than employment as a slave, and before the Industrial Revolution that is how most people worked. But in pursuit of enhanced productivity, society seeks to force all citizens into compliant productiveness, even if they are not made happier so. Religious and political doctrines have served to further this aim, and these days advertising keeps us trapped in materialistic status-seeking.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: serif;">3: Sleeping In</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Robert Louis Stevenson noted in 1885 that 'Idleness ... does not consist in doing nothing, but in doing a great deal not recognised in the dogmatic formularies of the ruling class.' John Keats declared that 'it is more noble to sit like Jove than to fly like Mercury'. Oscar Wilde lauded the 'life that has for its aim not doing but being, and not being merely, but becoming'. And yet idlers are often viewed by society as people with too much time to think, who could become revolutionaries.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: cursive;">Lesson 1: If your work is important to you, the fear of doing it will never go away.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">We always think that if we practice enough, we’ll get so good we’ll never have any problems with our work, ever</p> <p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">again.</p><br><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">But that’s not true.</p><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Henry Fonda was so obsessed with acting that he had to throw up before coming on stage, every single time even when</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"> he was 75 years old and a world famous actor already.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">If you truly care about your work, you’ll always be worried about your performance, and that’s a good thing, because it</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"> means you’re still trying to get better. So don’t stop when you’re afraid and instead, move on in spite of fear. After all,</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"> this is the definition of courage.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;">Lesson 2: Don’t take action and reflect at the same time.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Guess what the worst time is to edit a blog post? Right after you wrote it. It’ll be impossible to objectively reflect on</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"> your work, because you just finished it, and are naturally proud of what you did – and you should be.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">But that’s why it’s important to give yourself some temporal and physical distance, before judging your work. I’ll even</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;"> take it a step further and suggest this:</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: cursive;">When in doubt, don’t reflect at all.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">There are approximately 3,712 ways for a guy to look stupid during pregnancy - this book's here to help you avoid all most of them. And here's your first hint: Focus on what you can be doing for her rather than what's happening to her.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">She's pregnant. She knows that. You know that. And her 152 baby books tell her exactly what she can expect. Your job is to learn what you can do between the stick turning blue and the drive to the delivery room to make the next nine months go as smoothly as possible. That's where John Pfeiffer steps in.</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Like any good coach, he's been through it. He's dealt with the morning sickness and doctor visits, painting the baby's nursery and packing the overnight bag, choosing a name, hospital, and the color of the car-seat cover. All the while he remained positive and responsive - there with a "You're beautiful" when necessary - but assertive during the decision-making process (he didn't want to wind up with a kid named Percy). And now it's your turn.</p>

		<h2 style="float: left;">Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</h2><a href="gallery.html"><img src="image/close.png"></a><br><br>
		<center><img src="image/b14.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Amy Chua's Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother bears a disclaimer on the cover that it was originally meant to be a book about the clash between Chinese and Western parenting practices but instead is about Chua's own humbling experience with raising her daughters. As the book begins, Chua describes the strict rules that she established early on for her two daughters, Sophia and Louisa. The rules primarily address forbidden activities such as attending sleepovers, getting less than an A in classes, and being involved in school plays. The author admits that while her standards might seem rather stringent to most, they are common among Chinese mothers.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">In Chapter 2, Chua introduces her firstborn child, Sophia, and with her description of Sophia's rather passive personality and ability to learn quickly, it seems that Chua's strict Chinese parenting methods will prove to be successful. Chua's husband Jed is Jewish, and they decided upon marrying that they would bring up their children Jewish, instead of focusing on Chua's Catholic religious heritage. For Sophia, this decision seems to work perfectly. She demonstrates the questioning nature of her father's ideology along with her mother's obsession with rote and drill.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Chua's second child, Louisa (nicknamed Lulu), possesses completely different attributes. The author admits that Lulu inherited her "hot-tempered" and "viper-tongued" personality. That commonality is most likely the impetus for their "nuclear warfare" relationship. Chua also points out that according to the Chinese calendar, Lulu was born in the Year of the Boar, which supposedly predestines one to be willful and obstinate.The author herself was born in the Year of the Tiger, which causes one to be powerful and authoritative. The first recorded clash between the Boar and Tiger occurs when Lulu (the Boar) is three.</p>

		<center><img src="image/b15.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">I spent a big chunk of 2013 working from an office bathroom. It was, as office bathrooms go, extremely well-appointed: a big single-stall room with some fancy candles, a bottle of high-class hand soap, and an armchair upholstered in a dachshund print. But it didn’t have any windows, and when you sat in the beautiful, expensive-feeling chair, as I did to pump breast milk twice a day, you were facing a toilet.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">I’d returned to my job at a media start-up 12 weeks after having my first son, full of enthusiasm and nearly devoid of practical knowledge. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the woman who ran my local chapter of La Leche League said it was good to breastfeed for at least a year, so that was my entire plan: breastfeed, somehow, for at least a year. I wanted to be a working mom; aside from the obvious financial benefits, I believed that having a career was good for me and would be good for my family. I hadn’t factored in the hours I would spend managing my team by email while preventing them from emptying their bladders.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Lauren Smith Brody’s new guide to working motherhood, The Fifth Trimester, aims to help women avoid exactly this kind of situation. Brody was an executive editor at Glamour, and she takes a women’s-magazine approach to the difficult task of coming back to work, covering the frustrating realities of working-mom life in a chipper, big-sisterly voice.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">There are chapters about everything from managing your boss’s expectations to managing your postpartum work wardrobe. And of course, there’s an entire chapter on pumping — a time-suck, a literal suck, and likely the most embarrassingly physical thing you’ll ever have to explain to your co-workers.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;"> ACCEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR KID’S FEELINGS</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Emotions drive behavior, even when that behavior is baffling to you because you don’t understand why a carrot pointing the “wrong” way on their plate is cause for a total meltdown (just an example). Identifying the emotion behind the behavior in question is the first step toward addressing any problems that behavior creates.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Denying a Kid’s Feelings Can Exacerbate ProblemsYou want them to trust their emotions, so don’t give them a reason to doubt themselves. Why the carrot is making them freak out is much more important than how ridiculous it is that they’re freaking out in the first place.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Bad Behavior Is A Problem, Not A Character Flaw If your response to their misbehavior makes them feel bad about themselves, you’ve taken the focus off a situation that can be improved and put it on something a lot more complicated — or did you want to take a deep dive into their psyche while they’re trying to pull the tail off the dog?</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Punishments Create More Problem Than They Solve Contrived consequences like time outs and grounding can modify behavior in the short term, but they don’t teach a kid much because you don’t get any buy-in from the kid. It’s a top-down system that demoralizes when what you really want is to enlighten and instruct.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Kids need affirmation to build a healthy degree of self-esteem, but don’t overdo it or they could wind up feeling like the world owes them everything they want. There’s a spectrum that starts at “confident” and ends at “entitled”; aim for the former.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Tom Rath knows a thing or two about business – maybe you’ve heard of his most popular book already, it’s called Strengthsfinder 2.0.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">However, in order to even become one of the world’s leading business thinkers, he first had to learn a lot about something else: health. Tom was diagnosed with a rare disease called VHL at a very young age, which basically promotes random tumor growth all over your body. Instead of throwing in the towel, he decided to focus on what he could control.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">The little changes he made ended up amounting to a pretty healthy lifestyle and have allowed him to live a long and happy life (he’s 40 now and thriving!). But if these little changes helped him go from cancer patient to healthy, bestselling author, they sure must be good enough to help you and me live to be 90 and beyond.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">If you’re like most people, you’ll not exercise for a while, then feel bad and start setting really ambitious goals, like going to the gym 5 times a week. Even if you’re one of those rare types, who can pull off these kinds of sudden habit changes, there’s still a chance it’s the wrong thing to do.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Here’s why: If you sit for six hours a day, even working out for two hours afterwards won’t reverse the health damage you’ve done. The consequences are similar to those from smoking.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Exercise isn’t about the total amount of sweat you produce each week, your body only cares about not being inactive for a long stretch of time. Ever. The National Institutes of Health looked at 240,000 peoples’ movement behavior, finding out sitting for most of your time increases your mortality rate by 50%.</p>

		<center><img src="image/b18.jpg"></center>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">The Fat Smash Diet is the book-length version of the nutrition and fitness regimen that Dr. Ian K. Smith has used with great success and to widespread acclaim on VH1’s popular weight-loss reality show, Celebrity Fit Club. In the book, Smith outlines a simple weight loss plan that foregoes trendy gimmicks and focuses instead on a rigorous, commonsense approach. Dr. Smith avoids delving into the emotional complexities that many other experts regard as the chief component of weight problems and instead emphasizes the physical mechanics and bodily processes that have been consistently linked to successful weight loss efforts, both in scholarly research and in Smith’s experiences working with a diverse range of clients.</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Smith’s Fat Smash Diet plan proceeds in four distinct, but interrelated phases that are designed to carry the reader through not only the initial weight loss, but also through a lifetime of healthy weight maintenance and beneficial nutrition and exercise habits. The plan is geared to be flexible and adaptable to the ups and downs, changes and transitions that characterize real life. As such, Dr. Smith has included some latitude for social situations and stressful times that may impede one’s ability to stick to a healthy fitness and nutrition program. If a person who has reached the maintenance phase of the plan regresses, slips up, or otherwise regains weight, Dr. Smith recommends returning to the first phase of the diet for a 10-day period of rehabilitation. This unusual level of flexibility distinguishes the Fat Smash Diet from other, less realistic weight loss plans, and positions individuals using this approach to develop the skills and strategies that are necessary to achieve and maintain weight loss in the long-term.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">This is my book summary of Are You Fully Charged by Tom Rath. My notes are informal and often contain quotes from the book as well as my own thoughts. This summary also includes key lessons and important passages from the book.
		Daily well being is what we should be targeting. The new research on daily experiences has changed the way we think about health, happiness, and well being. Scientists can now study the day to day experiences of individuals often in minimally invasive ways. (Fitbit, etc.) 3 keys to bring fully charged: meaning, positive interactions, and energy. “The odds of being completely engaged in your job increases by 250% it you work on meaningful projects each day.” The pursuit of meaning, not happiness is what makes life better. The more value you place on your own happiness, the more likely you are to feel lonely. If you spend your time seeking your own happiness then you end up feeling more shallow or self-absorbed. Meaning, however, makes you feel better by giving yourself to a cause bigger than yourself. Fredrickson's research found that 70% of people had higher happiness levels vs meaningfulness levels. These people displayed a similar genetic markers as those in stressful and adverse situations.
Study of teenagers showed that those with a higher percentage of meaningful behaviors had lower levels of depression. 2014 study followed them for a full year and tested them in an fMRI scanner about hedonic acts vs meaningful acts.
Spend time listing the positive impact your work does. Attach meaning to the small things you do and “connect the dots between your efforts and a larger purpose.” It's important to understand how you contribute value.
The differences in how we view our work can just be a result of the stories we tell. You can tell a negative version of the story or you can tell a positive version. Which true version do you want to believe?

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Sounds so obvious but common sense isn’t so common. Most young people I meet have openly admitted that they spend every bit of what they make every paycheck.

This is one of my pet peeves that annoys me most. I know secretly that they will not get rich if they make more money (like they often complain and wish for) because they will just spend more and return down to zero in the bank account.</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">This is probably one of the golden truths of wealth creation that is voiced in many classics like Rich Dad Poor Dad. Kevin O’Leary of Shark Tank explains this well. He imagines every dollar like little soldiers. Everyday, his mission is to capture more soldiers and get those soldiers to work to capture even more soldiers.

Most people are using that money on things that rust, rot, or deteriorate to a net worth of zero. These include houses, cars, boats, clothing, watches, jewelry, or any merchandise. You’re making someone else rich by doing that.</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">What are the smart people doing? They’re taking every dollar they save and spending that on something that will make them MORE money. Usually, it’s on something that they’re skilled at or can understand: a basketball player might spend it on basketball lessons, a programmer might spend it on an exclusive programming in-person training, a businessman might spend it on a small business that will make him more money.

Warren Buffett did this ever since he was a baby. He bought soda in a store and sold it to people in the summer for multiple times the price. He eventually worked his way up to buying pinball machines and setting them up in restaurants. He split the profits 50/50 with the restaurant owners. He slowly worked up to bigger and bigger businesses until he became the richest man in the world. This law is a less frequently voiced law of wealth and business but so crucial.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;">The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">In this chapter, Friedman promotes economic freedom as both a necessary freedom in itself and also as a vital means for political freedom. He argues that, with the means for production under the auspicies of the government, it is nearly impossible for real dissent and exchange of ideas to exist. Additionally, economic freedom is important, since any "bi-laterally voluntary and informed" transaction must benefit both parties to the transaction.</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;">The Role of Government in a Free Society</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">According to the author, the government of a liberal society should enforce law and order and property rights, as well as take action on certain technical monopolies and diminish negative "neighborhood effects." The government should also have control over money, as has long been recognized in the constitution and society</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;">The Control of Money</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">He discusses the evolution of money in America, culminating in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Far from acting as a stabilizer, the Federal Reserve failed to act as it should have in several circumstances. Friedman proposes that the Federal Reserve have a consistent rule to increase the money supply by 3-5% annually.</p>

		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;">Strive to Save 10% to 20%</p>
		<p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">Originally, Pollack suggested that 20% of gross income should be the goal, but the authors have softened on this point. The suggestion is now 10-20% of net income, stating that more is better and that, if double-digits is not feasible at the moment, some is better than none. In the authors’ estimation, this savings rate is what’s necessary to secure our financial future and that, given the power of compounding interest, starting sooner than later matters.

Further, learning how to save effectively drives our success in executing on every other point. If we don’t have money, we can’t pay down debt, put money in retirement savings, invest or buy a home. In short, living paycheck-to-paycheck is not a way to ensure our financial success over the long term. If moving away from this behavior is proving difficult, the authors suggest conducting a personal spending audit to help you clarify needs vs wants. Finally, forget the latte factor. It’s the big stuff that kills us financially: housing, transportation and health care spending. Finding ways to reduce spending in these areas can make a big difference in creating some much-needed financial wiggle room, making it possible to set up to three months of expenses aside in an emergency fund.</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 0px; font-family: cursive;">Pay Your Credit Card Balances Every Month</p><p style="font-size: 20px; text-indent: 30px; font-family: serif;">The authors argue that the high interest rates associated with credit cards make it a necessity to pay off the full balance every month (beware of the lure of paying only the minimum as doing so will keep the debt around for years). They also stress that credit cards have a tendency to lead to overspending – in the order of 20% more on average. If spending is an issue, they strongly suggest sticking to cash.</p>
